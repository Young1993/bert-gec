A chimpanzee is perhaps the animal most closely related to humans; but instead of treating the animal with love and respect, we subject it to cruel and inhumane scientific and medical experiments to further human development.
What a cruel fate for the unfortunate chimpanzee. Or perhaps, in life as in the jungle it is survival of the fittest, and so, as the most intelligent animal we are just exercising our right to dominate and use other animals as we wish.
